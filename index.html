        <h2> My favorite place in my school is the big wooden stage we have outside of our auditorium. This is my favorite place because every Friday, our school has a big assembly, and every grade is there, along with me and my friends. It is a lot of fun, and I miss going to the stage for Friday morning assemblies and special occasions. I hope I can go back to the stage at one point soon!!! </h2>

        <h2> One thing that is new about our school is that since the COVID-19 crisis has put all of us into lockdown, we can't go to school on campus anymore! But luckily, we found a solution to our problem, which is online classes from home so that we can keep progressing and learning new things every day! Go raptors!!! </h2>
        <h1> Friday Morning Assemblies Going Digital! </h1>
        <img src="fma.jpeg">
        <h2> One more great thing that is new about our school is that since we are at home and can't have our traditional Friday morning assembly every Friday, the school is digitally having the assembly by making a video about everything going on around our school! Now, every grade gets to see the video posted every Friday, and it sure is awesome!!! </h2>
